# MEAN-stack overview
This web app was developed for a MEAN stack online course.  The premise is similar to that of a social media site in which users can create posts that contain pictures and descriptions.

# Stack
The MEAN stack utilizes Angular for the frontend, MongoDB for the database, and Node.js with Express for the backend (MEAN).

# Content and Features
The PWA utilizes angular material design for styling (accordian, buttons, input, etc).  It implements pagination for displaying posts.

# Live Site
The backend code was not included in the repo because it contains sensitive info for access to the database and JWT password.  However, the site is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk at: http://nodeangularguide-env.eba-gdz22hwg.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
